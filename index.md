## About


`Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for everybody` is a one day workshop that provides the researcher of any discipline to develop an understanding of Free/Open Source, beyond the technical realm, as a model of research development. Participants will be put into groups by main disciplines (medicine, humanities, social sciences, computer science, natural sciences, ...) to apply the FOSS-framework to their respective fields and they will submit their work at the end of the event. After the event, all submissions will be featured and archived on [https://slam.phil.hhu.de/libreslam](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/libreslam) for individual disciplines to continue to spread the FOSS-Way.

At the end of the workshop, researchers will be equipped to design their research development practices the FOSS-way at both the Individual and at the Organizational level.
