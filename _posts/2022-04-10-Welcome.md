LibreSlam's website is up! We are excited to bring you the first-of-its-kind Free and Open Source Workshop from [Slamlab](https://slam.phil.hhu.de). 

#FOSS4ALL is a one day workshop that aims to provide researchers of any discipline with an understanding of Free/Open Source, beyond the technical realm, as a model of research development. Participants will be put in groups by main disciplines (medicine, humanities, social sciences and computer science, natural sciences...) to apply the FOSS-framework to their respective fields and submit their work at the end of the event. After the workshop, researchers will be equipped to design their research development practices the FOSS way at both the individual and the organizational level. The submissions will be archived and featured on this website as a means of spreading the FOSS way and showcasing the work.

Participation in the workshop is free, but you need to register via the form <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/WYNHM9qv75O7NPWYasELohmQrMpi11vfbR7hRGHNmMo/">here</a>.
