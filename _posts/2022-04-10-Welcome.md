LibreSlam's website is up! We are excited to bring you the first-of-its-kind Free and Open Source Workshop from [Slamlab](https://slam.phil.hhu.de). 

#FOSS4ALL is a one day workshop that aims to provide researchers of any discipline with an understanding of Free/Open Source, beyond the technical realm, as a model of research development. Participants will be put in groups by main disciplines (medicine, humanities, social sciences and computer science, natural sciences...) to apply the FOSS-framework to their respective fields and submit their work at the end of the event. After the workshop, researchers will be equipped to design their research development practices the FOSS way at both the individual and the organizational level. The submissions will be archived and featured on this website as a means of spreading the FOSS way and showcasing the work.

Participation in the workshop is free, but you need to register via the form <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/WYNHM9qv75O7NPWYasELohmQrMpi11vfbR7hRGHNmMo/">here</a>.

## Talks

### Introduction to FOSS: taking baby steps towards freedom

Speaker: [Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/authors/akhilesh/)

**Abstract**

This talk presents an introductory dive into Free and Open Source Softwares (FOSS). It shall mainly cover the philosophy behind FOSS and the benefits of adopting the FOSS ideals in research development. 

### FAIR4RS Principles

Speakers: [Ekaterina Gabrovska](https://www.ulb.hhu.de/en/the-library/organisation-locations-contact/staff-directory?pid=382&redirect=1) and [Helge Ahrens](https://www.ulb.hhu.de/en/the-library/organisation-locations-contact/staff-directory?pid=365&redirect=1) 

**Abstract**

The scientific process and output should be accessible, understandable and reproducible. These characteristics are addressed by the FAIR principles for research data and now also research software as well as by the FOSS idea. In this talk we would like to introduce FAIR4RS and FOSS concentrating on openness. We will show how the ULB uses open software to support research at the HHU and how we contribute to the community. As example we will introduce VuFind®, our discovery system behind katalog.ulb.hhu.de. VuFind® is a modular open source software, which is constantly optimized as well as customized by the community and ourselves.
